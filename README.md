# Warehouse Management System

Welcome to my first large-scale project! This project was born out of the necessity to manage goods efficiently within a warehouse. Given my initial lack of web development knowledge, I opted for the Tkinter framework for the user interface. Below, I'll outline the key features, implementation details, and some pros and cons of the project.

## Implementation

- The project incorporates both SQL and MongoDB databases.
- MongoDB code is not connected with all tables.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
1. **User-Friendly Interface:** The Tkinter interface provides a simple and familiar user experience.
2. **Table Editing:** The system allows easy manipulation of warehouse data with various actions.
3. **Dual Database Support:** Implementation supports both SQL and MongoDB.

**Cons:**
1. **Static Design:** The project's static nature may limit customization for diverse use cases.
2. **MongoDB Integration:** MongoDB code is not fully integrated with all tables, potentially limiting functionality.

**Note:** As this is my first big-scale project, improvements and changes are encouraged, considering the static nature of the project.

Feel free to explore, use, and modify this project as needed. Happy coding!
